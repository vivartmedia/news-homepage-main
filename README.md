 // Brief Description of what you did: copied a prototype to be as close as possible to the design using html Tailwind css

Peer Review, Sebastian Breve-Sanchez: The website is pretty close to the original design. The main thing that stands out is the hovering colors that don't work. Another thing is that you are using tailwind colors when ideally you should be using the colors inside the style guide. For tablet, I would recommend adding borders to the sides and changing the bottom three areas to be one on top of each other. Mobile is good, just that the third one of the bottom 3 has a spelling mistake and the first one has the number "02".
